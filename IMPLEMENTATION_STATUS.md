## ⚠️ Known Gaps

| # | Gap | Severity | Affected File | Fix Required |
|---|-----|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | "Attempt DPP" / "Take Test" button missing in **gallery view** | Minor | `LectureListing.tsx` | Add quiz button under gallery card |
| 2 | "Attempt DPP" / "Take Test" button missing in **table view** | Minor | `LectureListing.tsx` | Add quiz button in table row |

> **Impact:** Students who prefer gallery/table mode won't see the quiz button. Default is list view so most users are unaffected.
